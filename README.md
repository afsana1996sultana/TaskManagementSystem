Hello sir…..
Here,,....I will try to give the proper instruction to setup this laravel project on your local Xampp Server.
The project name is TaskManagementSystem.
Laravel Version --10.0
Php Version – 8.1
Database – MySQL
At first download the project from git repositories then unzip the project and run from the htdocs in Xampp server on your local PC.
Create a .env file and copy the code from .env.example file and paste it in the .env file.
Create a database and configure it in the .env file like username and password.
Then run the command php artisan migrate.(I will provided the mysql file also)
Then run the command composer update
Then run the command php artisan optimize:clear
Then run the command php artisan serve.

Flowing this instruction,,..I hope the project will be running successfully on your local server.

//Api Endpoint Test
I will provide a json collection within the code and the json collection path is…
TaskManagementSystem\JSON_Collection

//Deployment in the live server
I deployed the project on this live server for testing and the live link is…
https://taskmanagement.appiflybd.com

I hope it will help you to test the project.
Thank you.
